I'm a programmer, cybersecurity enthusiast and wannabe hacker. I like writing about cybersecurity, programming and hacking.

I have a experience with a lot of technologies, but I'm most familiar with:
- Rust
- TypeScript
- Sass/SCSS
- C#

I want to build an ecosystem on the shoulders of purely open source software. I want to create a way of internet without trackers or relying on proprietary software. 

I promote privacy, cryptography and freedom.
